# Golang Algorithms And Benchmarks

 This repository contains examples of classic algorithms and comparative benchmarks implemented in Golang.

 ## Index

 ### Classic Algorithms

- [fibonacci](./code/classic-algorithms/fibonacci/): The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example used to study algorithm designs. In this directory we present some implementations: Using recusivity, Dynamic Programming, Matrix Exponentiation and Closed Formula.

 ### Golang Benchmarks

- [string-construction](./code/golang/string-construction/): Go program that benchmarks two methods of string construction: using `fmt.Sprintf` versus string concatenation (`+` operator).

- [maps](./code/golang/maps/): Go program that benchmarks searching for elements: using map lookups versus sequential search in slices.
